## Hello, world!

Hey, hi and welcome to my blog.

I've always wanted to start writing about my journey as a developer and now I've finally taken that step. After taking a look at a few different platforms for blogging, I've decided to use Hashnode. It's focused on developers, supports markdown and gives me full ownership of my blog â€“ great!

Expect to see posts about all aspects of modern web development, from frontend to backend and even some devops. Thank you for visiting and consider subscribing to my newsletter to never miss a post.

See you around  
Simon
